🚀 Power BI Dashboard – Technical Support Center Analytics
📅 Date: 29-05-2025

I’ve built an end-to-end Power BI report that provides a comprehensive overview of a global Technical Support Center's operations. The dashboard is divided into four powerful sections, enabling performance tracking, SLA compliance, and agent productivity in real-time.

📌 1. Ticket Volume Overview
This dashboard presents a consolidated view of ticket inflow by source (Email, Chat, Phone), priority level (High, Medium, Low), and country.

Total of 2,330 tickets analyzed.

Major ticket source: Email (52.96%)

Top reporting countries: Germany, Poland, United Kingdom

Highest volume topic: Product Setup
This page offers high-level visibility into ticket trends and support load.

📌 2. Ticket Log Details
A detailed ticket-level dashboard tracking every interaction:

Live statistics:

Open: 18

In Progress: 400

Resolved: 739

Closed: 1,000

SLA performance: First Response & Resolution time

Includes agent-level details: source, interactions, priority, status, and customer rating

Great for service managers who want to monitor real-time workload and ensure SLA policies are enforced at the agent level.

📌 3. SLA Performance – First Response & Resolution
In-depth SLA compliance insights:

First Response SLA Met: ✅ 86.65%

Resolution SLA Met: ✅ 66.39%

Violations mostly linked to:

Low-priority tickets

Chat and Email channels

Global breakdown of ticket types by country and SLA status

This helps identify SLA gaps by channel, country, and priority, allowing leaders to take targeted corrective actions.

📌 4. Agent Performance Dashboard
A complete performance matrix by agent:

Tracks ticket volume, SLA adherence, and violations

Top SLA performer: Kristos Westoll

Highest-rated agents:

Bernard Beckley (181 reviews)

Sheela Cutten (187 reviews)

Ticket complexity visualized by average agent interactions

Ideal for recognizing top contributors and identifying training needs based on SLA and customer satisfaction metrics.
